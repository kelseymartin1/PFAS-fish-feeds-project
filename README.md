PFAS-fish-feeds-project

This project seeks to explore the levels of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) that are present in commercially available fish feeds. 

The questions we seek to answer are:
1. At what levels are PFAS present in fish feeds?
2. Do feeds higher in fish meal (fm) have higher PFAS content than those with plant protein (pp), animal protein (ap), and soybean meal (sm)
3. Do feeds with a higher protein percentage (protein_per) have higher PFAS content?
4. Are there significant differences in PFAS content between manufacturers?

I will be looking at 4 compounds. These compounds are PFOS, PFNA, PFDA, and PFUnA. I will run a multiple linear regression for each compound.
